To launch a Spark standalone cluster with the launch scripts, you should create a file called conf/slaves in your Spark directory, which must contain the hostnames of all the machines where you intend to start Spark workers, one per line. If conf/slaves does not exist, the launch scripts defaults to a single machine (localhost), which is useful for testing. Note, the master machine accesses each of the worker machines via ssh. By default, ssh is run in parallel and requires password-less (using a private key) access to be setup. If you do not have a password-less setup, you can set the environment variable SPARK_SSH_FOREGROUND and serially provide a password for each worker
